# multipage-site
## Nick Smith
Final project for CIS133, multipage website with weekly reviews of every album I listened to that week. I wrote a small paragraph about what I thought about the album, then I gave it a rating out of 5. 4 weeks-worth of albums starting from Feb 6th to Mar 5th. Albums were restricted to 2022 releases only.

Formatting for each review is as follows:

*Arist* -- Album Title | Genre | Release Date X/5*

*Rating out of 5
